Malicious User Detection
########################

F5 XC has the capability to indentify and track user sessions based on different parameters like: client IP, TLS Fingerprint, Cookie value, HTTP Header value and many others.

Based on these identifires we can track user behaviour and visualise it while at the same time we can take decisions on when to block the user or just challange it.
