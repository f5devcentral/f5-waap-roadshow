Lab 2 - Testing
###############

In order to test we will use an online free proxy server.

To perform this test you can use any of the following proxy sites:


:ext_link:`https://www.hidemyass.com/en-us/proxy`

:ext_link:`https://hide.me/en/proxy`



1. Use proxy server of you choosing and enter the Arcadia App URL: :ext_link:`http://arcadia-re-$$makeId$$.workshop.emea.f5se.com/`

2. The requests coming from the proxy servers will be blocked with a 403 status code.
