Unified Demonstration Framework or in short UDF is a tool developed and maintained by the F5 UDF Team for creating reusable, maintainable, and shareable environments of F5 products. Its main purpose is to facilitate collaboration and the sharing of knowledge among subject-matter experts and allow others to easily benefit from that knowledge.
