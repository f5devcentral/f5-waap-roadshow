Welcome to the WAAP Roadshow!

The hands-on experience is splitted in three progressive sections: Fundamental, Intermediate and Advanced.
Through the following labs, you will find:

- On the **Fundamental lab** (30 minutes) you will find out how to publish a modern Web Application on F5 Distributed Cloud and secure it with a Web Application Firewall Policy and Bots signatures.
- The **Intermediate lab** (40 minutes) will guide you on tweaking the policy to add value and increase the security with Parameter inspections, IP Intelligence, Malicious User Detection, Bot Advanced and Layer 7 DDoS. 
- The **Advanced lab** (40 minutes) will introduce API Protection and Discovery.

Before getting into the hands-on tasks, you will first find some preparation instructions and lab pre-requisities set up.
:underline:`Please, follow them carefully and reach out to the instructor if you meet any issue`.
